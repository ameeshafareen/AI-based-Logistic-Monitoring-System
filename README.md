AI Logistics Monitoring System (Package Damage Detection & Route Optimization)

An AI-powered logistics monitoring system that detects package damages using deep learning and suggests optimized delivery routes using historical route data.
This project was developed and tested entirely on Google Colab for simplicity and easy reproducibility.

🚀 Features

Package Damage Detection: Uses a pre-trained CNN model (TensorFlow/Keras) to classify packages as Intact or Damaged.

Route Optimization: Analyzes historical route data to suggest safer paths and reduce chances of package damage.

Colab-Ready: No setup needed on your machine — just open the notebook in Google Colab and run it.

🛠 Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python
Deep Learning: TensorFlow / Keras (CNN for image classification)
Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy
Visualization: Matplotlib
Platform: Google Colab

▶️ Getting Started (Google Colab)

Open the Colab notebook: notebook.ipynb
Upload your dataset to Colab (or mount Google Drive).
Run the notebook cells in order.
Install dependencies (TensorFlow, etc.)
Train/Load the pre-trained CNN model
Test package damage detection
Load historical route data and run optimization module
View results in the Colab output cells (graphs, predictions, route suggestions).

-> Example Outputs

✅ Package classified as Intact
❌ Package classified as Damaged
📍 Suggested optimized route based on historical delivery damage trends

-> Future Improvements
1.Extend to real-time GPS route monitoring.
2.Integrate with a live logistics dashboard (Streamlit / Flask).
3.Include delay prediction along with damage detection.
